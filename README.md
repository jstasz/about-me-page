### Projects

Adding new project based on class Project with constructor : (title, description, img, gitHub, www, prepair);
Each project has a link to gitHub. It also can have link to www. If some project is in the process you can add comment by set prepair at true. 

To add a new project, you need to create a new variable based on the Project class using the following template:

const newProject = new Project(
  `title`,
  `description`,
  `used technologies`,
  image(imported from the src/images folder),
  `GitHub link`,
  `URL`, 
);

App to render projects does it automatically. There are three projects on the front page. You can watch more project if you want or click link to gitHub if you want to watch all.
